- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons
- **Data Fetching**: Tanstack React Query
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Routing**: File-based routing with App Router
  - `/` - Landing page (homepage with search form)
  - `/search` - Search results page (clinic listings with filters)

### Key Dependencies
- Backend: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pymongo`, `google-generativeai`, `googlemaps`, `google-cloud-storage`
- Frontend: `react`, `next`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `axios`, `lucide-react`

## Architecture Overview

### Core Features
1. **Clinic Finder**: Location-based search for free/low-cost healthcare facilities
2. **AI Chat Assistant**: Gemini-powered guidance for healthcare questions
3. **Cost Transparency**: Clear pricing information for common medical services
4. **Resource Education**: Information about healthcare rights and assistance programs

### API Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check for all services
- `GET /clinics` - Get all clinics (simple array response)
- `POST /clinics/search` - Search clinics by location and filters (preferred for frontend forms)
- `POST /chat` - AI-powered healthcare guidance
- `POST /clinics` - Add new clinic to database
- `GET /clinics/{id}` - Get specific clinic details

### Database Schema (MongoDB)
```json
{
  "clinics": {
    "name": "string",
    "address": "string", 
    "phone": "string?",
    "services": ["array of strings"],
    "pricing_info": "string?",
    "languages": ["array of strings"],
    "hours": "string?",
    "walk_in_accepted": "boolean",
    "lgbtq_friendly": "boolean", 
    "immigrant_safe": "boolean",
    "website": "string?",
    "notes": "string?"
  }
}
```

## Development Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # IMPORTANT: Always activate virtual environment first
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For refactored structure (recommended for team development):
python -m app.main  # Runs on http://localhost:8000

# For legacy single file:
python main.py  # Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Environment Variables Required

### Backend (.env)
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For geocoding and maps
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI chat functionality
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` - Google Cloud project ID for storage
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Storage bucket name (default: care-compass-photos)

### Frontend (.env.local)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` - Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - For Maps JavaScript API and frontend maps integration

## Target Users & Use Cases
- **Primary**: Uninsured individuals seeking affordable healthcare
- **Secondary**: Community health advocates, social workers
- **Use Cases**:
  - "I need a checkup but don't have insurance"
  - "Where can I get mental health services on a sliding scale?"
  - "Can I get emergency care if I can't pay?"
  - "What are my rights for receiving medical care?"

## Justice & Safety Considerations
- **Privacy-first**: Anonymous browsing, no required personal information
- **Accessibility**: Simple language, mobile-friendly design
- **Trust-building**: Clear disclaimers, source transparency
- **Bias prevention**: Inclusive filters (LGBTQ+ friendly, immigrant-safe)

## Hackathon Demo Flow
1. User enters ZIP code + health concern
2. System shows nearby free/low-cost clinics with filters
3. AI explains clinic options in plain language
4. User can ask questions about healthcare rights/options
5. Optional: Save favorite clinics with simple signup

- "urgent care Houston self pay"
- "sliding scale healthcare Houston"

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Prioritize clinics with published cash/sliding-scale prices
- Known Houston clinics with pricing: NeuMed, Texas MedClinic, AFC West University, Insight Urgent Care, FastMed, Texas Health Breeze
- Store exact pricing when available, mark as "Contact for pricing" when unavailable
- Weekly automated refresh via cron job to keep data current

## Next Development Steps

## Important Notes for Claude
- Always run `npm run lint` after frontend changes
- Backend uses MongoDB with proper error handling
- Frontend should be responsive and accessible
- Focus on simple, clear language for healthcare guidance
- Prioritize user privacy and safety in all implementations
- Test API endpoints with proper error responses
- Follow healthcare industry best practices for disclaimers
- The reason pip isn't working is because you need to have activated the virtual environment. please try it with this in mind and remember this in the claude.md file
- Don't put the comments of the directories at the top of the files
- Don't use emojis in comments
- Don't use emojis in logs or console output

## MongoDB Query Fixes Applied
- **Database Name**: Fixed mismatch between seeder.py (`carecompass`) and main.py (`care_compass`) - now both use `carecompass`
- **Geospatial Search**: Implemented proper MongoDB geospatial queries using `$geoNear` aggregation pipeline
- **Distance Calculation**: Added distance_meters field to search results showing actual distance from search location
- **Environment File**: Renamed `.local.env` to `.env` so dotenv can find it properly
- **Data Structure**: Clinic data includes GeoJSON Point coordinates for proper geospatial indexing
- **Radius Filtering**: Properly converts miles to meters and filters results within specified radius
- **Search Endpoint**: Use POST `/clinics/search` instead of GET with query params for better frontend integration

## Maps JavaScript API Implementation

### Interactive Map Features
- **Real-time clinic visualization**: Shows all filtered clinics as markers on an interactive map
- **Custom markers**: Color-coded markers (green for walk-ins accepted, red for appointment needed)
- **Info windows**: Rich popups with clinic details, services, pricing, and action buttons
- **User location**: Blue marker showing user's current/searched location
- **Auto-fitting bounds**: Automatically adjusts zoom and position to show all relevant clinics
- **Click-to-scroll integration**: Clicking map markers scrolls to corresponding clinic in results list

### Map Layout Options
- **Side-by-side view**: On large screens (lg+), map and clinic list display side-by-side
- **Sticky positioning**: Map stays in view while scrolling through clinic results
- **Responsive toggling**: Mobile devices show map/list toggle, desktop shows "Map & List"/"List Only" toggle
- **Smart defaults**: Map visible by default for better user experience

### Map Component Structure
```typescript
// Key GoogleMap component props
interface GoogleMapProps {
  clinics: Clinic[];                    // Array of filtered clinics to display
  userLocation?: { lat: number; lng: number };  // User's location
  onMarkerClick?: (clinic: Clinic) => void;     // Callback for marker interactions
  height?: string;                      // Customizable map height
  className?: string;                   // Additional styling
}
```

### Maps API Configuration
- **Required APIs**: Maps JavaScript API, Places API (for geocoding)
- **Script loading**: Dynamic script injection with promise-based loading
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when Maps API fails to load
- **Performance**: Efficient marker management with cleanup on component unmount
- Remember to alwasys test http requests with HTTPie, not curl.

## Photo Integration Implementation Notes
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Photos are cached in `care-compass-photos` bucket with public read access
- **Photo Processing**: Limited to 3 photos per clinic during seeding to manage API costs
- **Authentication**: Uses Application Default Credentials for local development (`gcloud auth application-default login`)
- **Legacy Places API**: Required to be enabled in Google Cloud Console for photo access
- **Database Indexes**: MongoDB creates geospatial, text search, and filter indexes for performance
- **Error Handling**: Photo failures don't block clinic seeding - clinics added with empty image_urls arrays
- **Cloud Run Ready**: Service account permissions configured for production deployment
- **API Integration**: All existing endpoints now return `image_urls` field in clinic responses
